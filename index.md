# Welcome to my personal webpage!

My name is Owen Chase, and I am currently a second-year student in the PhD program in the Department of Astronomy at UT Austin. 
I am also a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow. 
I hold Bachelor of Science degrees in Astronomy and Statistics from Penn State University. 
I graduated summa cum laude from the Schreyer Honors College and Eberly College of Science in 2022. 


My primary research interests are cosmology, large-scale structure, and astrostatistics. 
I am currently working as a member of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment ([HETDEX](https://hetdex.org)) collaboration. 
Our goal is to achieve percent level cosmological parameter constraints using the BAO signal in our catalog of >1M Lyman-$$\alpha$$ emitting galaxies.
I am co-advised by Drs. Julian Mu&ntilde;oz and Karl Gebhardt.
