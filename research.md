  <div class="tile-content">
    <p class="tile-preview">I am working as a member of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX) collaboration. Our goal is to achieve percent level cosmological parameter constraints using the BAO signal in our catalog of >1M Lyman-Î± emitting galaxies.</p>
    <p>The project involves analyzing large-scale structure patterns in the distribution of galaxies to measure the expansion history of the universe and constrain dark energy properties. This work combines observational astronomy with advanced statistical analysis techniques to extract cosmological information from galaxy surveys.</p>

    <p class="tile-preview">This research focuses on using the Planetary Nebula Luminosity Function as a standard candle for measuring extragalactic distances.</p>
    <p>The PNLF method provides an important rung in the cosmic distance ladder and helps calibrate other distance measurement techniques. By studying the bright end of the planetary nebula luminosity function, we can determine distances to nearby galaxies with high precision.</p>

  <div class="tile-content">
    <p class="tile-preview">This project involves analyzing the variability patterns of quasars to understand their underlying physical processes and improve our understanding of active galactic nuclei.</p>
    <p>The research combines observational data analysis with statistical modeling to characterize quasar behavior across different timescales and wavelengths.
